A BDM Capstone Project titled “Advanced Digital Data Management and Demand Forecasting Framework for Pattern House Boutique”. The project focuses on digitalization of manual diary records, inventory optimization, and sales forecasting. It covers data cleaning, trend analysis, machine learning–based demand prediction.
This repository contains my Business Data Management (BDM) Capstone Project titled “Advanced Digital Data Management and Demand Forecasting Framework for Optimizing Inventory & Sales in a Women’s Boutique.”

The project is based on Pattern House, a local women’s boutique that originally managed all orders and inventory using handwritten diaries. The first goal of this work is to convert manual records into clean, structured digital data, using Excel for data entry, cleaning, and basic preprocessing.

Once the data is prepared, the project applies trend analysis to understand monthly sales patterns, category-wise performance (Gown, Lehenga, Kurta, etc.), and festival season peaks. It then uses machine learning (Linear Regression) to build simple sales and demand forecasts, helping the boutique plan inventory and staffing for upcoming months.

The project also performs ABC analysis to classify products into A, B, and C categories based on revenue contribution, which supports smarter stocking decisions. In addition, correlation analysis is used to study relationships between variables such as total amount, advance paid, product types, and time, giving deeper insight into customer and payment behavior.

Overall, this repository shows a complete pipeline:

Data digitalization and cleaning

Exploratory and trend analysis

Sales forecasting using ML

ABC inventory classification

Correlation-based business insights

The methods are practical and focused on real small-business use cases, helping Pattern House move from guesswork to data-driven inventory and sales planning.
